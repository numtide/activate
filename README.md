# activate - a small resource converging tool

**status: experimental**

Most of NixOS is declarative and congruent but there is always a little bit of
state that has to be pushed towards a desired state. Instead of relying on a
pile of bash script to do the work, we propose a small tool that is designed
to be complementary, and has for ambition to replace most of the NixOS
activation script.
